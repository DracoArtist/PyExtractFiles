This folder is intended to provide a simple way to extract all the PDF (or other types of) files from the file structure and copy them to a separate directory. 
To use the code in copy_files.py, follow these steps:

- Download 'ExtracFiles' and the directory containing the files you want to extract to your computer, or find another way to provide the code 
    with the path to said directory.

- Be careful not to include the 'allfigures_source', 'OGRAPH_extracted', and 'OGRAPH directories', as they may contain some PDF files that are outdated, 
    which the code will copy as well.

- Run the '__main__.py' file of 'ExtracFiles' and follow the instructions inside the GUI to provide the code with the appropriate path.

Enjoy!
